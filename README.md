This lead me to wonder, is an endorsment from the former president mean all that much? There has been some previous work in this area before suggesting Trump was good a picking likely winners rather than changing the outcome of an election. https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/almost-everyone-trump-endorses-wins-their-primary-but-is-he-padding-his-record/. Has this changed at all? Are his endorsements worth the same as they were when he was still in office?

Can we quantify the power of his enorrsement as a function of other variables to predict the impact of his endorsement on future races?

Depiste being a political topic, my aim is to objectively look at the numbers and draw conclusions based on what the data shows.
